# Ticket Evolution

Ticket Evolution is a web application that allows users to purchase concert tickets and enables event coordinators to create new events. The project is built using HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and Node.js/Express for the back end. It features a fully responsive design with a baby blue background theme.

## Features

  - **Home Page:** Displays a carousel of concert images and quotes.  
  - **Purchase Tickets:** Lets users buy tickets. The event selection dropdown is dynamically populated from the back-end.  
  - **Create Event:** Allows event coordinators to create and post new events with detailed information.

- **Back-End API (Node.js/Express):**  
  - **Static File Serving:** Serves all front-end files from the `public` folder.
  - **API Endpoints:**  
    - `GET /api/events` - Retrieves all created events.
    - `POST /api/purchase` - Processes ticket purchase submissions.
    - `POST /api/create_event` - Processes new event submissions.
  - **In-Memory Data Storage:** For demonstration purposes, event and purchase data are stored in memory.
